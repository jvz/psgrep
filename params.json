If you wish to install `psgrep`\r\nsomewhere other than `/usr/local/bin`, set the `$PREFIX` variable like so:\r\n\r\n    PREFIX=/usr sudo ./install.sh\r\n\r\nThe default `$PREFIX` is `/usr/local`\r\n\r\nIf you, for example, install `psgrep` to your home directory, don't forget to set\r\nyour `PATH` to include `~/bin` as well as your `MANPATH` (or `~/.manpath`) to include\r\n`~/share/man`.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to install this as an actual package on your system, you will need\r\nthe `checkinstall` program.  General syntax you can follow (just accept defaults):\r\n\r\n    PREFIX=/usr sudo checkinstall ./install.sh\r\n\r\nFor example, on my Debian/[K]Ubuntu-based system, I could run:\r\n\r\n    PREFIX=/usr sudo checkinstall -D -A all --gzman ./install.sh\r\n",
